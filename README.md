## 📖 About

The project aims to make **Java a first-class language for mobile development**.  
We document goals, plans, and technical steps for supporting:

- **iOS** (JVM, libraries, frameworks, JavaFX, app packaging)
- **Android** (tooling and build integration)

Focus is first on **libraries**, then on **applications**.
