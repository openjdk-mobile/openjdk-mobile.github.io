# Java on Mobile

**Bringing real Java to mobile.**

Java runs everywhere — server, cloud, and desktop — but running it seamlessly on mobile remains challenging. This project aims to fix that by creating the code, tools, and documentation to make Java a first-class citizen on iOS and Android.

A key part of this effort is the [OpenJDK/mobile](openjdk-mobile.md) project — an official downstream repository of OpenJDK/jdk containing the minimal patches required for JVM and library support on mobile devices. Our long-term goal is to upstream these patches into OpenJDK/jdk, eliminating the need for a separate repository.

We focus on two main use cases:

- **Java libraries on mobile** – Allow developers to take existing Java libraries and convert them into fully supported components on mobile platforms.
- **Java applications on mobile** – Enable developers to write full mobile applications in Java, including JavaFX-based apps.

> ⚠️ Note: This is not yet a tutorial for building mobile apps in Java. The goal is to build the infrastructure that makes it possible. We hope contributors will help fill the remaining gaps.
